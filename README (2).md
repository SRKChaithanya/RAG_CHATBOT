## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the RAG_CHATBOT locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SRKChaithanya/RAG_CHATBOT.git
cd RAG_CHATBOT
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is assumed to be present in the project root containing all necessary dependencies.)*

### 4. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory based on a `.env.example` (if provided) or manually. This file will store your API keys and other sensitive configurations.

```
# Example .env content
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
# Add any other necessary environment variables here
```

Replace `"your_openai_api_key_here"` with your actual API key.


## üöÄ Usage Examples

Once installed, you can run the API and the application components.

### 1. Start the API Server

Navigate to the `api` directory and start the FastAPI server:

```bash
cd api
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The API will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 2. Run the Chatbot Application

Navigate back to the project root and then into the `app` directory. Run the main application (e.g., a Streamlit app, Flask app, or CLI script):

```bash
cd ../app
python main.py # Or streamlit run app.py, depending on your app
```

### Basic API Interaction (Example)

You can interact with the API directly using `curl` or a Python script:

```bash
# Example using curl to send a message to the chatbot API
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chat" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "message": "What is the capital of France?",
           "session_id": "user123"
         }'
```

```python
# Example using Python requests
import requests

api_url = "http://localhost:8000/chat"
payload = {
    "message": "Tell me about Retrieval-Augmented Generation.",
    "session_id": "user123"
}

try:
    response = requests.post(api_url, json=payload)
    response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
    print(response.json())
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error communicating with the API: {e}")

```

### Chatbot UI (if applicable)

If your `app` directory contains a web-based UI, open your browser and navigate to the address where the application is hosted (e.g., `http://localhost:8501` for a Streamlit app).

## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to the RAG_CHATBOT project! Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration.

### Code Style

*   Adhere to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style.
*   Use a linter (e.g., `flake8` or `pylint`) and formatter (e.g., `black`) to maintain consistent code formatting.

### Branch Naming Conventions

*   Use descriptive branch names.
*   For new features: `feature/your-feature-name` (e.g., `feature/add-openai-integration`)
*   For bug fixes: `bugfix/issue-description` (e.g., `bugfix/fix-api-error-handling`)
*   For documentation updates: `docs/update-readme`

### Pull Request Process

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2.  Ensure your code adheres to the code style guidelines.
3.  Write clear, concise commit messages.
4.  Open a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch of the original repository.
5.  Provide a detailed description of your changes in the PR, including the problem it solves and how it was tested.
